Event Management System (DSA-Based)
📌 Title

Event Management System – Data Structures & Algorithms Project

📄 Short Description

A Java-based Event Management System implementing Data Structures & Algorithms for efficient scheduling, attendee management, and resource allocation.

🧩 Brief Description (for Project Cards)

DSA-powered Event Management System built in Java for efficient event scheduling and attendee tracking.

📘 Full Description

The Event Management System is a comprehensive console-based application developed using Java and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) principles.
The system is designed to manage events efficiently by handling scheduling, attendee tracking, budget management, and resource allocation in a structured and optimized manner.

This project demonstrates the practical use of object-oriented programming and DSA concepts to solve real-world event coordination challenges. It supports customizable events, secure handling of data, and scalability for managing multiple event scenarios.

The system focuses on performance, modular design, and maintainable code, making it suitable for academic use and foundational system design learning.
